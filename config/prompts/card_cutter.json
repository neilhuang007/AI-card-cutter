Place <HL>...</HL> placed around complete word(s) you are citing. Add brief connective words/phrases in parentheses inside the <HL> spans only if needed. Never alter text outside parentheses. Highlighted text should connect to a sentence. If fetching fails, return status=fetch_error and set cite and content to empty strings. Output JSON according to output schema. \nRules: Do not fabricate content. Keep the entire paragraph exactly as on the page except for <HL> spans and optional parenthetical connectors inside them. Use multiple <HL> spans if highlighting more than one complete sentence in the paragraph. If no suitable paragraph is found, still return status=success with the strongest available paragraph; only use fetch_error when the page cannot be fetched. Prioritize quoting parts of multiple sentences and DO NOT attempt to quote the entire sentence unless necessary, quote less words as possible and include statistics to save reading time for evidence.",
